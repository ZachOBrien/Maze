(define DEFAULT-SHIFT-STEP 1)

;; A Gamestate is a structure:
;;    (struct Board Tile [NonEmptyListof PlayerInfo] (U Shift #f))
;; interpretation: A Gamestate has a board, an extra tile, players arranged in the order they
;;                 take turns (with the currently acting player at the front of the list)
;;                 and the last shift made
