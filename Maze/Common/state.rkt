;; DATA DEFINITIONS



;; A PlayerID is a Natural
;; interpretation: A player's unique ID
(define player-id? natural-number/c)

;; An AvatarColor is one of:
;; - "red"
;; - "green"
;; - "yellow"
;; - "blue"
;; interpretation: The color of a player's avatar
(define avatar-color? (or/c "red" "green" "yellow" "blue"))


;; A Player is a structure:
;;    (struct PlayerID GridPosn GridPosn [Listof Gem] Date AvatarColor)
;; interpretation: A player has an ID, a current position, home position, goal treasure,
;;                 birthday, and avatar color
(struct player [id curr-pos home-pos goal-treasures dob color])

;; Create a new player
(define (player-new id curr-pos home-pos goal-treasures dob color)

;; A Move is a structure:
;;    (struct ShfitDirection Natural Orientation GridPosn)
;; interpretation: A move made by a player. A move has a ShiftDirection, the index of
;;                 a row/col to shift, the orientation of the newly inserted tile,
;;                 and the position the player will move to
(struct move [shift-dir index orientation pos])

;; A Gamestate is a structure:
;;    (struct Board Tile [NonEmptyListof Player] [NonEmptyListof PlayerID] PlayerID (-> Move Boolean))
;; interpretation: A Gamestate has a board, an extra tile, players, the order in which the players
;;                 take turns, the ID of the currently acting player, and a function representing
;;                 whether a move would reverse the previously made move
(struct gamestate [board extra-tile players player-turn-order current-player reverses-prev-move])

;; Board Tile [NonEmptyListof Player] [NonEmptyListof PlayerID] -> Gamestate
;; Create a new gamestate
