;; DATA DEFINITIONS


;; A Move is a structure:
;;    (struct ShfitDirection Natural Orientation GridPosn)
;; interpretation: A move made by a player. A move has a ShiftDirection, the index of
;;                 a row/col to shift, the orientation of the newly inserted tile,
;;                 and the position the player will move to
(struct move [shift-dir index orientation pos])

;; ShiftDirection Natural Orientation GridPosn -> Move
(define (move-new shift-dir index orientation pos)
  (move shift-dir index orientation pos))


;; A Gamestate is a structure:
