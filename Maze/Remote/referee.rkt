; Do we need an else case that calls msg-handling-loop again?
; what to do in the case of bad message in player, throw away? or quit game?
; when returning nothing, is it any?
; do we need to do any tests other than the one I have for proposed-board, theoretically we are testing the propose board function in the player class so we may not need to
; How are we going to create a player-state here? wouldn't we need to have access to the player information, does having access to the player information defeat the point of a proxy -
; Do we have to have some notion of waiting for some time in receive-json or will it just hang until we get something
